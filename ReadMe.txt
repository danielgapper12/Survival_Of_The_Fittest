 We decided to program a game with inspiration from Dead Ops Arcade in Black Ops 1.

 When you start the game you are trying to escape from the zombies.

 You can shoot at them and kill them, but they respawn.


How to Play 

Use the WASD keys to move, a combination of 2 keys allows you to move diagonally.

Left click allows you to shoot in the direction of your mouse.

Ammo respawns randomly collection an ammo coin brings your ammo back to 8.

Shooting zombies adds 100 points to your score.

The Game ends when hit by a zombie.
